# Traefik Static Configuration
# This file configures Traefik's core functionality including entrypoints,
# certificate management, and providers.

# API and Dashboard (optional - enable for debugging)
api:
  dashboard: false # Set to true to enable the Traefik dashboard
  insecure: false # Never expose the dashboard without authentication

# Entry Points - Define how traffic enters Traefik
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
    # Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
