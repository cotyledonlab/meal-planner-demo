# GitHub Copilot Instructions Migration

**Note**: GitHub Copilot instructions have been consolidated into the main `AGENTS.md` file at the repository root.

## Migration Details

- **Old location**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **New location**: `/AGENTS.md` (repository root)
- **Status**: All content has been migrated and brought to parity

## Why the Change?

To maintain a single source of truth for all AI assistant configurations, we've consolidated:
- GitHub Copilot instructions
- Cursor IDE rules
- Other AI assistant guidelines

All into the unified `AGENTS.md` file. This ensures consistency across all development tools and makes it easier to maintain project guidelines.

## For Users

If you're using GitHub Copilot, it will automatically read from `AGENTS.md` via the update scripts. No action needed on your part.

## Legacy File

The old `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file is kept for reference but is no longer actively maintained. Please refer to `/AGENTS.md` for the latest guidelines.
